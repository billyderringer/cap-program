    <p>
      Scheduling HVAC appointments with homeowners has never been easier. The Lead and Customer Management Dashboard
      tool offers CAP Dealers a new Scheduling Preferences feature that lets homeowners choose their preferred times
      within the Dealer Locator form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple to use, Scheduling Preferences is the ultimate solution for better planning efficiency and time management.
      Improve your customer experience by working with your homeowner's busy schedule. Save time and work more efficiently --
      remove the manual process of writing names, addresses, times, and dates on pieces of paper, whiteboards or sticky notes.
